# Half Adder:
  - The  most basic digital arithmetic circuit is the addition of two binary digits (two bits)
  - Input variables of a half adder are called the augend and addend bits
  - The output output variables the sum and carry
  - Necessary to specify two output variables because the sum of 1 + 1 = 10
      - Symbols x and y to the input variables
      - S (sum) and C (carry) to the output variables
      - C output is 0 unless both inputs are 1
   
  - Equations:
      S = x'y + xy' = x âŠ• y (XOR) <br>
      C = xy

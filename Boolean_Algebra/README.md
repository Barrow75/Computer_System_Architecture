Boolean algebra serves as a foundational framework for repesenting and manipulating logical expressions using binary variables
Boolean algebra is the mathematical basis for designing digital circuits, which are the heart of all electronic devices

x + 0 = x <br>
x + 1 = 1 <br>
x + 1 = 1 <br>
x + x = x <br>
x + x' = 1 <br>

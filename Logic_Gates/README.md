Manipulation of binary information is done by logic circuits called gates.
Gates are blocks of hardware that produce signals of binary 1 or 0 when input logic requirements are satified.

# AND Gate: 
- Logical multiplication of binary digits where 1 is called a high and 0 is called a low
- The output is 1 if the input A and B are both equal to 1
Algebraic Function of AND Gate:
  > AB
  > Aâ€¢B

Truth Table:
A  B  |  x  <br>
------------  <br>
0  0  |  0  <br>
0  1  |  0  <br>
1  0  |  0  <br>
1  1  |  1  <br>

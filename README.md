Logic Gates are the physical building blocks: <br>
      - Made from transistors using CMOS technology <br>
      - Uses gates such as AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR and are wired in the transistor level <br>


Boolean Algebra is the language of the gates: <br>
      - This is how we design, simplify, and describe what the gates should do <br>
      - Turn a system requirements into a circuit

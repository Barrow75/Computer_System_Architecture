Logic Gates are the physical building blocks: <br>
      - Made from transistors using CMOS technology <br>
      - Uses gates such as AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR and are wired in the transistor level <br>
      

Boolean Algebra is the language of the gates: <br>
      - This is how we design, simplify, and describe what the gates should do <br>
      - Turn a system requirements into a circuit <br>
      
Combinational Circuit: <br>
      - THESE ARE LOGIC GATES <br>
      - Takes the boolean logic inputs and instantly processes them using logic gates and gives the output <br>
      - Has no memory or time delay <br>
      - ALU, Multiplexers and Decoders and fast calculations <br>
  
     
Flip Flops provide memory (aka state holding): <br>
      - They are built from gates and store 1 bit of data <br>
      - These are used in Registers to store CPU values, Counters and Control units <br>
      - Flip flops are small memory cells hat remembers the bits 1 or 0 <br>

Sequential Circuit: <br>
      - Made from both logic and flip flops <br>
      - Remembers the result of operators overtime <br>
      - In order for the logic circuit to know what to do with the Boolean algebra it needs the flip flops to hold these boolean values <br>
      - The flip-flops inside a sequential circuit hold the state, so that it can remember previous inputs, and feed that state back into the logic circuit to decide what happens next. <br>
